  "about.what_is": "What is DOF-RAG?",
  "about.project_description": "DOF-RAG is a development project that seeks to bring the information from Mexico's Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) closer to the general public. The DOF publishes laws, decrees, and reforms almost daily that impact everyone's lives, but this information is often extensive, technical, and difficult to understand.",
  "about.project_objective": "Our goal is to build a system that allows easily querying and understanding the content of the DOF, using artificial intelligence technologies that explain and summarize the information in a clear and contextualized way.",
  
  "about.how_it_works": "How does the system work?",
  "about.how_it_works_description": "The system we are developing is based on an architecture called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which combines intelligent search with advanced language models.",
  "about.how_it_works_additional": "This allows that, when asking a question or searching for a topic, the system locates the relevant information in the DOF documents and generates a clear and understandable response for the user.",
  "about.key_processes": "Among the key processes are:",
  "about.process_1": "Extraction and processing of DOF documents to convert them into machine-readable formats.",
  "about.process_2": "Semantic indexing, which allows precise searches based on the meaning of the text.",
  "about.process_3": "Generation of answers with language models that explain and contextualize information.",
  "about.process_4": "All this is done with AI tools that work locally, without depending on external services.",

  "about.team_member_2": "Learners who are learning about natural language processing, creation of question-answering systems, embeddings, and open source language models.",
  "about.team_purpose": "Our work is done collaboratively, with the purpose of contributing to democratic access to legal and regulatory information in Mexico.",
