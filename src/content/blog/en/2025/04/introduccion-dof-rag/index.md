The **DOF-RAG Project** emerges as an initiative to improve the accessibility and understanding of information contained in Mexico's Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) through the use of advanced natural language processing and information retrieval technologies.

## What is DOF-RAG?

DOF-RAG is a system based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture specifically designed to:

1. **Extract relevant information** from the Official Journal of the Federation
2. **Index and organize** this information efficiently
3. **Facilitate the search and retrieval** of specific data
4. **Generate precise answers** to queries about regulations, rules, and official publications

## Importance of the project

The DOF contains critical information about laws, regulations, agreements, and other official documents of the Mexican government. However, due to its large volume and complexity, finding specific information can be a complicated and time-consuming process.

Our system aims to democratize access to this information, allowing citizens, researchers, legal professionals, and public officials to quickly obtain the data they need, presented in a clear and contextualized manner.

## Technologies used

The DOF-RAG project integrates various cutting-edge technologies:

* **Semantic vectorization**: To represent documents in a vector space that captures their meaning
* **Vector databases**: To efficiently store and retrieve vectorized information
* **Large-scale language models**: To generate precise and coherent responses

## Initial objectives

In this first phase of the project, we have set out to:

1. Develop an efficient and reliable data extraction system from the DOF
2. Implement a basic but functional RAG architecture
3. Evaluate the accuracy and relevance of generated responses
4. Establish a solid foundation for future improvements and expansions

In upcoming publications, we will be sharing specific advances on each component of the system, challenges encountered, and implemented solutions.

We appreciate your interest in our project and invite you to follow our blog to stay informed about advances in DOF-RAG.
